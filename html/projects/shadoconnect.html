    <!-- Description Card -->
    <div class="project-card">
      <p>ShadoConnect is a comprehensive healthcare career development platform built using Lovable frameworks for rapid, component-driven development, React for building interactive, stateful user interfaces with efficient rendering and component reusability, and other modern web development tools including state management libraries, routing solutions, and API integration frameworks. The platform serves as a sophisticated digital bridge connecting ambitious students pursuing healthcare careers with experienced professionals who offer valuable shadowing opportunities, structured internships, and personalized mentorship relationships. Students create detailed, comprehensive profiles showcasing their academic interests, professional goals, career aspirations, relevant coursework, volunteer experiences, and specific areas of medical interest, while healthcare professionals list their medical specialties, clinical availability, mentoring preferences, preferred student backgrounds, and commitment levels. The AI-powered matching system employs advanced algorithms to intelligently pair students with providers based on multiple weighted factors including precise medical specialty alignment, geographic proximity with distance calculations, schedule compatibility analysis, and deep career goal alignment assessment. The platform includes sophisticated real-time scheduling functionality that seamlessly integrates with popular calendar systems like Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar, enabling automatic availability synchronization and conflict detection. A comprehensive messaging system facilitates direct, secure communication between students and professionals with support for file attachments, read receipts, and message threading. Advanced application tracking provides detailed status monitoring for shadowing requests with workflow states including pending, under review, accepted, declined, and completed, along with timeline tracking and automated status update notifications. The matching algorithm employs machine learning techniques to continuously improve pairing quality by considering specialty preferences with weighted importance, precise location data with radius-based filtering, availability windows with time zone handling, and career trajectory analysis that predicts long-term compatibility. Automated notification systems keep both students and professionals informed about new matches with personalized recommendations, schedule changes with conflict alerts, application updates with detailed status explanations, and milestone celebrations that encourage continued engagement and relationship building.</p>
